			<p>One Piece is a Japanese animation/cartoon also known as 'anime', this particular show is about a couple of pirates who've obtained powers via mysterious fruits try to find the treasure, as a pirate would. This treasure is seeked out by all who were influenced to go to sea by the one pirate who had obtained "all the world had to offer". He left this treasure somewhere in the world on an island before being executed by the World Government. Once he announced that he had left his treasure for anyone to find, thousands of pirates set to find this treasure called the "One Piece", hence the name. The particular pirate group in "One Piece" focuses on is the 'Straw Hat Pirates' which consists of Luffy - Captain, Zoro - Righthand man, Nami - Navigator, Usopp - Sharpshooter, Sanji - Cook, Chopper - Doctor, Robin - Archeologist, Franky, - Shipwright, Brook - Bard.</p>
