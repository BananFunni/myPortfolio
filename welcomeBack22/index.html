      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This website is about what I did over the summer with friends and family.</p>

      <h2>Water Safari</h2>
      <p>Me, my mom, my brother and my grandma went to Water Safari on August 15th and we went on rides like the Killermanjaro's Revenge, Curse of the Silverback and Cascade falls.</p>

      <h2>Movies</h2>
      <p>My friends and I went to go see Jurassic World: Dominion sometime after it came out and being the dino nerds we are, we were able to name quite a few of them.</p>

    <section id="fishing">
      <h2>Fishing</h2>
      <p>I went fishing with my friends and I caught and released a little sun fish, my first ever catch. I was slightly aggressive when yanking it in so it got me back when I cut my finger throwing it back out.</p>

    <section id="malonefair">
      <h2>Malone Fair</h2>
      <p>My brother, friends and I went to the Malone Fair and rode all of the rides like Zero Gravity, Twister, Swings, we even went into the mirror fun house. At sometime near the end each of us got little plastic swords that hooked to out pant loops.</p>
